                    I have made the process of downloading and setting up Sparx Maths Helper as simple as i could, just follow these steps and you should be fine.<br><br>1. click this to start the download: <a href="sparxBot.zip" download>-SparxMathsHelper-</a><br><br>2. Once installed, should only take a few seconds or so, go to the download location in file explorer and extract the folder (right click the folder and click extract / extract all)<br><br>3. The folder icon should look like a normal folder now and not a zipped icon, so go ahead and open the "sparxBot" folder<br><br>4. Open the file called "settings.txt" or "settings", replace the info there with your School and Login for sparx to auto login for you.<br><br>5. Double click the file called "sparxBot", it should have an icon that looks like a blue save disk.<br><br>6. A windows message might apear saying "Windows protected your PC", in this case just click the <u>More info</u> text, then click "Run anyways".<br><br>7. The program should open google chrome, then login into sparx using the credentials you put in earlier, now just do sparx like normal, with the UI on the right to help.
